Description: The namer function in R is used to clean and modify the names of columns in a data frame. It removes spaces, digits, and any non-letter character from column names and replaces them with an underscore. It also converts the column names to lowercase. The dupliDrop function is used to remove columns with duplicate names from a data frame. It identifies columns with the same names and removes them, keeping only one instance. The dupliFind function is used to find and identify columns with duplicate names in a data frame. It outputs the index number and names of the columns that have the same names.
